# How do Digital / Computational Archaeologists interact?

## a very skewed personal view

### papers and conferences
- CAA (duh)
- JCAA, Journ Arch Science, Internet Arch
- paper repositories, as ReserachGate and academia."edu"

- -> just like everyone else

### repositories for code accompagnying papers
- OSF.io
- zenodo.org
- paper specific repositories

- -> exchange of code, usually commented at least with a README

### blogosphere
- Jeremy Hugget: https://introspectivedigitalarchaeology.com/ ,
- Andre Costopoulos: https://archeothoughts.wordpress.com/ ,
- Joe Roe: https://joeroe.io/,
- Isaac Ullah: https://isaacullah.github.io/,
- me and Sebastian Hageneuer: https://archaeoinformatics.net/

- -> space for elaborating on a point in a more relaxed way
- -> space to ask questions in context


### Twitter
- hashtags like #Rstats, #Python, #ComputationalArchaeology, #DigitalArchaeology
- CAA chapters @CAADE5,  CAA_Australasia, @caanlfl) and international CAA (@CAA_Int)
- SIGs (SIG-SSLA: @CAA_SSLA, SIG Data Dragons: @CAADataDragon)
- archaepapers with code bot by Ben Marwick (@archpaperscode)

- -> a lot and very varied input, very much up-to-date
- -> more discussion of blog posts than in the blogosphere

### YouTube
- tutorials (ISAAKiel, Recording Archaeology)
- introductions / discussions of tools (not usually arch-specific)

- -> less discussion, more easy attainable information

### Github / Gitlab
- Ben Marwicks CTV: https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology 
- github.io --> Books / Tutorials (e.g. https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/ )

- commenting and working together
- sharing of scripts / developments / packages
- **this is what this workshop will be about**
