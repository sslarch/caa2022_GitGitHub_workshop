# How do Digital / Computational Archaeologists interact?

## Why is this important?

- digital & computational skills are often learned informally
- often Digital Archaeologists are alone in their instutions
- exchanging ideas and solutions with others helps a lot
  - how do I get code examples?
  - how did they do that exactly?
  - what do I need to be able to try that analysis?

- that's why we founded the SIG SSLA


## networks and SIGs

it's not just us:

- Special Interest Group Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology ([SIG SSLA](https://sslarch.github.io/))
- [Discord Channel Computational Archaeology](https://discord.com/invite/Z9UXwjASM5)
- Rchaeology [https://rchaeology.github.io/](https://rchaeology.github.io/)

## papers and conferences

- CAA (duh)
- JCAA, Journ Arch Science, Internet Arch
- paper repositories, as ReserachGate and academia."edu"

--> just like everyone else


## repositories for code accompagnying papers

- [OSF.io](https://osf.io/)
- [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/)
- paper specific repositories

--> exchange of code, usually commented at least with a README

## blogosphere

- Jeremy Hugget: [https://introspectivedigitalarchaeology.com/](https://introspectivedigitalarchaeology.com/) ,
- Andre Costopoulos: [https://archeothoughts.wordpress.com/](https://archeothoughts.wordpress.com/) ,
- Joe Roe: [https://joeroe.io/](https://joeroe.io/),
- Isaac Ullah: [https://isaacullah.github.io/](https://isaacullah.github.io/),
- me and Sebastian Hageneuer: [https://archaeoinformatics.net/](https://archaeoinformatics.net/)

--> space for elaborating on a point in a more relaxed way

--> space to ask questions in context


## Twitter

- hashtags like #Rstats, #Python, #ComputationalArchaeology, #DigitalArchaeology
- CAA chapters @CAADE5, CAA_Australasia, @caanlfl) and international CAA (@CAA_Int)
- SIGs (SIG-SSLA: @CAA_SSLA, SIG Data Dragons: @CAADataDragon)
- other networks (@DigArchGroup, @Rchaeology1)
- archaepapers with code bot by Ben Marwick (@archpaperscode)

--> huge and very varied input, very much up-to-date

--> more discussion of blog posts than in the blogosphere

## YouTube

- tutorials (e.g. on [ISAAKiel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNhj3I--Xhm1plgLpR2V2Cw))
- recorded talks (e.g. on [Recording Archaeology](https://www.youtube.com/c/RecordingArchaeologyVideos))
- introductions / reviews of tools (not usually arch-specific)

--> less discussion, more easy attainable information

## Github / Gitlab
- Ben Marwicks CTV: [https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology) 
- github.io --> Books / Tutorials (e.g. [https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/](https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/))
- a number of packages / extensions for R, QGIS, Python...

--> commenting and working together

--> sharing of scripts / developmened solutions / packages

- **this is what this workshop will be about**
