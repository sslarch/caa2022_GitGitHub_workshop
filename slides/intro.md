# How do we interact?

## papers and conferences
- CAA (duh)
- JCAA, Journ arch science, Internet Arch
- paper repositories, as eserachGate and academia."edu"
--> just like everyone else

### repositories for code accompagnying papers
- OSF.io
- zenodo.org
- paper specific repositories
--> exchange of code, usually commented at least with a README

## social media

### blogosphere
- Jeremy Hugget: https://introspectivedigitalarchaeology.com/,
- Joe Roe: https://joeroe.io/,
- Isaac Ullah: https://isaacullah.github.io/,
- me and Sebastian Hageneuer: https://archaeoinformatics.net/
--> space for elaborating on a point in a more relaxed way
--> space to ask questions in context


### Twitter
- hashtags like #Rstats, #Python, #ComputationalArchaeology, #DigitalArchaeology
- CAA chapters @CAADE5,  CAA_Australasia, @caanlfl) and international CAA (CAA_Int)
- SIGs (SIG-SSLA @CAA_SSLA, SIG Data Dragons @CAADataDragon)
- archaepapers with code bot by Ben Marwick (archpaperscode)
--> a lot and very varied input, very much up-to-date
--> more discussion of blog posts than in the blogosphere

### YouTube
- tutorials (ISAAKiel, ?)
- introductions / discussions of tools (not usually arch-specific)
--> less discussion, more easy attainable information

## Github / Gitlab
- Ben Marwicks CTV: https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology 
- github.io --> Books / Tutorials (e.g. https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/ )

- commenting and working together
- this is what this workshop will be about
